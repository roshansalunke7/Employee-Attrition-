# Predicting Employee Attrition Using Classification Analysis-

The aim of this project is to develop an accurate predictive model to determine whether an employee is likely to leave a company. To achieve this goal, the project used a classification analysis approach, including multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression,Decision Tree, Random Forest,Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

The project started by gathering a comprehensive dataset of employee features, including demographics, job-related characteristics, work environment factors, and performance indicators. The dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical features.

Using the preprocessed dataset, the project implemented each of the machine learning algorithms mentioned above and compared their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall. The model with the highest performance was selected as the final product of the project.

The selected model provided valuable insights into the factors that contribute to employee attrition and helped to identify the most important features affecting employee retention. The project's success was measured by its ability to develop an accurate predictive model that can be used by HR professionals to make informed decisions about employee retention.

Overall, the project demonstrated the importance of using classification analysis in identifying the factors contributing to employee attrition, and how such insights can help companies retain their valuableÂ employees.
